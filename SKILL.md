# Agent Team Setup

Create a complete, production-ready opencode agent team for any project. This skill
scaffolds the full `.opencode/` directory: coordinator agent, subagents, skills, tools,
workspace, and the root `opencode.json` + `AGENTS.md` files.

## When to Use

- User wants to automate a multi-step workflow (research → plan → write → publish, etc.)
- User asks to "set up agents" or "create an agent pipeline"
- User wants opencode subagents that work together on a task
- User wants to replicate a working agent-team pattern in a new project

## Prerequisites

- The target project must already have opencode installed (`opencode` CLI available)
- The project should be a git repo (agents can commit/push)
- Python 3 must be installed (tools use Python scripts)

---

## Mandatory Reference-First Protocol

This is a reference-backed setup skill. Before answering, asking a clarification,
planning, choosing a configuration shape, or writing any generated file, first
use the file tools to inspect and read the relevant files in this skill's bundled
`references/` directory. Do not rely on memory for OpenCode behavior or invent
configuration fields.

The bundled `references/` directory belongs to this skill. Do not copy it into a
generated project, template, example, or target repository.

At minimum, read these references for every setup:

- `references/opencode-config.md` for `opencode.json` fields and schema
- `references/opencode-agents.md` for agent modes, models, and permissions
- `references/opencode-rules.md` for `AGENTS.md`, instructions, and file loading
- `references/opencode-permissions.md` for permission patterns and task access

Also read `opencode-skills.md`, `opencode-tools.md`, `opencode-commands.md`, or
the other reference files when the requested setup uses those features. Treat
the references as the source of truth. If they do not answer a question, read
the official schema or documentation before proceeding, and ask the user rather
than guessing when the behavior is still unclear. Inspect the target project's
actual files for project-specific facts; do not replace repository evidence with
assumptions.

This protocol applies to the agent using this skill while it is designing and
scaffolding a team. Generated projects should contain only their own
project-specific instructions and references.

---

## Phase 0: Model & Provider Setup

Before planning the team, decide which LLM model the agents will use. This skill
uses **OpenCode's provider by default** with the free **DeepSeek V4 Flash** model.
Model selection is a hard gate: decide it before creating any agent file and
carry the selected model through every generated agent.

### 0.1 Default: OpenCode free model

Unless the user specifies another provider or model, use:

```
opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free
```

This is the default model for the top-level `opencode.json`, the coordinator, and
every generated subagent. If OpenCode is not connected yet, tell the user to run
`/connect`, select OpenCode (OpenCode Zen), and use `/models` to confirm the model.
Never place provider credentials in generated project files.

### 0.2 Optional providers

Cloudflare and other providers remain supported when the user explicitly selects
them:

| Provider | Connection | Model ID example |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode free (default) | `/connect` → OpenCode | `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | `/connect` → Cloudflare Workers AI | `cloudflare-workers-ai/@cf/zai-org/glm-5.2` |
| ChatGPT/OpenAI | `/connect` → OpenAI | `openai/<model-id>` |
| Anthropic | `/connect` → Anthropic | `anthropic/<model-id>` |
| Google | `/connect` → Google | `google/<model-id>` |

ChatGPT free or paid login options depend on the installed OpenCode version and the
account. Use the authentication choices shown by `/connect`, then select the model
with `/models`.

### 0.3 Decision table

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| User says nothing about model | Use `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` for all agents |
| User says "use OpenCode" | Use `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` unless they name another OpenCode model |
| User says "use Cloudflare" | Use the selected `cloudflare-workers-ai/<model-id>` |
| User says "use ChatGPT" / "use OpenAI" | Use the model selected through `/connect` and `/models` |
| User says "inherit my connected provider" | Omit the `model` field so agents inherit global config |
| User names a specific model | Use that exact model ID |
| User wants different models per agent | Assign each model in its agent frontmatter |

The phrase "use OpenCode connect" means the default OpenCode provider unless the
user explicitly asks to inherit an already-connected provider. Do not silently
replace the OpenCode default with Cloudflare.

### 0.4 How the model appears in agent files

Every generated subagent `.md` file gets an explicit `model:` field in its YAML
frontmatter. Do not omit it just because `opencode.json` has a top-level model;
that omission is the regression this rule prevents.

```yaml
model: opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free
```

When a user chooses another provider, replace the value with that provider's model
ID. If the user explicitly wants agents to inherit the global model, omit the
`model` line entirely, and only then. A missing model line is never an acceptable
accident. For mixed models, set an explicit model on every agent and omit the
top-level model only if the project has no single default.

### 0.5 Model audit before completion

Before reporting that the team is complete:

1. Enumerate every generated file under `.opencode/agents/*.md`.
2. Confirm each file has exactly one intended `model:` frontmatter value, unless
   the user explicitly requested global inheritance.
3. Confirm `opencode.json` has the selected top-level model for a single-model
   team and that an inline coordinator also has an explicit `model` field.
4. Confirm every model ID matches the user's request or the documented default;
   fix any missing or inconsistent value before continuing.

Do not skip this audit or report success based only on a top-level model.

---

## Phase 1: Plan the Team

Before writing any files, gather the information below. Ask the user if anything is
unclear — do NOT guess.

### 1.1 What is the pipeline?

Ask: "What are the steps this agent team should perform from start to finish?"

Example answer: "Research a topic → write a blog post → generate images → publish it"

### 1.2 Identify the agents

Break the pipeline into 3-7 distinct roles. Each role becomes one subagent.

| Role type | When to use |
|---|---|
| Scout / Researcher | Gathers raw data from external sources |
| Planner / Analyst | Turns raw data into a structured plan |
| Creator / Writer | Produces the main output (article, code, document) |
| Specialist (image, SEO, test, etc.) | Does one specific task that needs special tools |
| Editor / Reviewer | Validates, formats, and polishes the output |
| Publisher / Deployer | Ships the output to production |
| Optimizer / Monitor | Post-publication maintenance and auditing |

### 1.3 Map the handoffs

For each agent, determine:
- **Input**: What does it receive? (topic, file path, URL, previous agent's output)
- **Output**: What does it produce? (file in workspace, URL, structured data)
- **Handoff mechanism**: Files in `.opencode/workspace/` (recommended) or inline in the task prompt

### 1.4 Identify custom tools

Does the pipeline need capabilities beyond what opencode + web search provides?

Common tool needs:
- Web scraping / search
- File analysis (NLP, keyword extraction)
- External API calls (image generation, translation, etc.)
- Platform-specific actions (deploy, upload, etc.)

Each tool = one Python script + one TypeScript wrapper.

### 1.5 Choose the model

**Default:** `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` (OpenCode's free DeepSeek V4 Flash
model). Use this for all agents unless the user asks for something else (see Phase 0).

All agents can share the same model, or you can assign cheaper models to simple tasks
and smarter models to complex ones. If the user wants different models per agent, set
the `model:` field in each agent's frontmatter accordingly.

### 1.6 Set temperatures

| Temperature | Use for |
|---|---|
| 0.1-0.2 | Deployment, publishing, validation (deterministic) |
| 0.3 | Research, planning, editing (focused) |
| 0.5-0.7 | Creative writing, brainstorming (expressive) |

---

## Phase 2: Scaffold the Directory Structure

Create the following in the target project root:

```
.opencode/
  agents/          # One .md file per subagent
  skills/          # One subfolder per skill, each with SKILL.md
  tools/           # Pairs of .py + .ts files per custom tool
  workspace/       # Runtime artifacts (create subdirs as needed)
    research/      # Scout output
    briefs/        # Planner output
    drafts/        # Writer output
    reports/       # Audit/optimizer output
    data/          # Shared data files
  package.json     # @opencode-ai/plugin dependency
  requirements.txt # Python dependencies for tools
  .gitignore       # Ignore node_modules, etc.
```

### 2.1 Create `.opencode/package.json`

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@opencode-ai/plugin": "latest"
  }
}
```

Then run `cd .opencode && npm install` (or let opencode handle it).

### 2.2 Create `.opencode/.gitignore`

```
node_modules
package-lock.json
bun.lock
```

### 2.3 Create workspace directories

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/workspace/{research,briefs,drafts,reports,data}
```

Add a `.gitkeep` to each if the project is git-tracked and you want the structure
committed but empty.

---

## Phase 3: Create the Coordinator

The coordinator is the **primary** agent — the one the user talks to first. It does
NOT do work itself; it delegates to subagents in order.

### 3.1 Add to `opencode.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "default_agent": "coordinator",
  "instructions": ["AGENTS.md"],
  "agent": {
    "coordinator": {
      "description": "Master orchestrator for the [PROJECT NAME] pipeline. Routes tasks to sub-agents in order.",
      "mode": "primary",
      "model": "opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free",
      "temperature": 0.2,
      "prompt": "You are the coordinator of [PROJECT DESCRIPTION].\n\nWhen the user gives you [INPUT TYPE], run the pipeline in order. At each step use the task tool with the matching subagent type and pass the [INPUT] (and any intermediate file paths) in your prompt. Do NOT do the agent's work yourself — delegate.\n\n1. Spawn the [AGENT_1] subagent with [INPUT]. It saves [OUTPUT_1] to [PATH_1] and returns a summary.\n2. Spawn the [AGENT_2] subagent with [OUTPUT_1_PATH]. It saves [OUTPUT_2] to [PATH_2].\n3. Continue for each agent in the pipeline...\n\nReport progress to the user after every step. If an agent fails or returns an error, stop and report the error to the user — never skip a step to work around a failure.\n\nIf the user asks for routine work unrelated to the pipeline, handle it directly or tell them what to do.",
      "permission": {
        "task": {
          "*": "deny",
          "[agent-1-name]": "allow",
          "[agent-2-name]": "allow",
          "[agent-3-name]": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key rules for the coordinator prompt:
- List each step explicitly with the agent name and what it receives
- Say "do NOT do the agent's work yourself — delegate"
- Say "stop and report errors — never skip a step"
- Say "report progress after every step"
- Include a fallback instruction for non-pipeline tasks
- Keep the selected model explicit in the coordinator and every subagent; do not rely on inheritance unless the user explicitly requests it

### 3.2 Add MCP servers (optional)

If the project uses a framework with an MCP server (e.g. Astro docs), add it:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "mcp-server-name": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 4: Create Subagents

Each subagent is a `.md` file in `.opencode/agents/`. The filename must match the
agent's `name` field.

### 4.1 Agent file template

```markdown
---
name: [agent-name]
description: [One sentence: what this agent does, when to use it]
mode: subagent
model: [model-id]
temperature: [0.1-0.7]
permission:
  edit:
    "*": ask
    "[allowed-write-paths]": allow
  bash:
    "*": allow
    "[allowed-commands]": allow
---
# [Agent Display Name]

[One line: what project/context this agent serves]

## Mission

[One sentence: the core job of this agent]

## Input

- [What the agent receives: file path, topic, URL, etc.]

## Steps

1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
...

## Output

[What the agent produces and where it saves it]

## Rules

- [Boundary: what the agent must NOT do]
- [Quality: what the agent must ensure]
- [Scope: what the agent should stay within]
```

### 4.2 Permission patterns

| Permission | Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `edit: {"*": ask}` | Default | Ask before editing anything |
| `edit: {".opencode/workspace/research/**": allow}` | Scoped | Auto-allow writes to specific dirs |
| `edit: {"src/content/**": allow}` | Code dirs | Auto-allow writes to source files |
| `bash: {"*": allow}` | All bash | Allow any shell command |
| `bash: {"python3 .opencode/tools/*.py *": allow}` | Scoped | Allow only tool scripts |
| `bash: {"git *": allow}` | Git | Allow git operations |

### 4.3 Key principles for agent design

1. **Single responsibility**: Each agent does ONE thing well. Don't make an agent that
   both researches AND writes.
2. **Clear handoffs**: Agent A's output is Agent B's input. Use files in
   `.opencode/workspace/` as the handoff mechanism — the coordinator passes file paths.
3. **No overlap**: Don't have two agents that do the same thing.
4. **Explicit rules**: State what the agent must NOT do (e.g., "do not write the article,
   do not touch src/content/").
5. **Realistic permissions**: Only give write access to the directories the agent needs.

---

## Phase 5: Create Skills

Skills are knowledge documents — "how to" guides that agents (or the user) load for
context on a specific domain.

### 5.1 When to create a skill

Create a skill when:
- An agent needs domain-specific knowledge (e.g., writing style guide, SEO rules)
- A workflow has reusable steps that could be documented separately
- A capability spans multiple agents (e.g., R2 upload used by illustrator AND editor)

### 5.2 Skill file template

Create `.opencode/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: [skill-name]
description: [One sentence: what this skill teaches, when to use it]
---

# [Skill Display Name]

[Context: what project/domain this applies to]

## [Section: Key concept or workflow]

[Content: steps, rules, templates, examples]

## [Section: Another concept]

[Content]
```

### 5.3 Skill vs Agent: when to use which

| Use an **agent** when... | Use a **skill** when... |
|---|---|
| Work needs to be delegated automatically | Knowledge needs to be loaded on demand |
| The task is a distinct pipeline step | The knowledge spans multiple agents |
| It needs its own permissions/model | It's reference material, not executable work |
| It saves files to the workspace | It's a style guide, checklist, or template |

### 5.4 Linking skills to agents

Mention skills by name in agent instructions:
> "Follow the writing rules in the writer-style skill."

The coordinator or agent can load the skill using the skill tool when needed.

---

## Phase 6: Create Custom Tools

Tools are executable scripts wrapped as callable opencode tools. Each tool = one
Python script + one TypeScript wrapper.

### 6.1 Tool file structure

```
.opencode/tools/
  tool_name.py     # The actual logic
  tool_name.ts     # The opencode wrapper
```

### 6.2 Python script template

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
[Tool description]
Usage: python3 tool_name.py <args>
"""
import sys
import json

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python3 tool_name.py <args>", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    arg = sys.argv[1]
    # ... do the work ...
    result = {"arg": arg, "status": "ok"}
    print(json.dumps(result, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 6.3 TypeScript wrapper template

```typescript
import { tool } from "@opencode-ai/plugin"
import path from "path"

export default tool({
  description: "[Tool description for the LLM]",
  args: {
    argName: tool.schema.string().describe("[arg description]"),
  },
  async execute(args, context) {
    const script = path.join(context.worktree, ".opencode/tools/tool_name.py")
    const result = await Bun.$`python3 ${script} ${args.argName}`.text()
    return result.trim()
  },
})
```

### 6.4 Tool design principles

1. **Python does the work**: All logic in `.py` file. The `.ts` file just calls it.
2. **JSON output**: Python scripts print JSON to stdout for structured results.
3. **Error handling**: Print errors to stderr, exit with code 1.
4. **No API keys in code**: Read from environment variables (`os.environ.get('KEY')`).
5. **One tool per file**: Don't combine multiple tools into one script.
6. **Idempotent**: Running the same tool twice should give the same result.

### 6.5 Python dependencies

List all Python package requirements in `.opencode/tools/requirements.txt`:

```
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
```

Install with: `pip3 install -r .opencode/tools/requirements.txt`

---

## Phase 7: Create AGENTS.md

The `AGENTS.md` file at the project root is the project-level instruction file. It
gives every agent (and the user's main session) context about the project.

### 7.1 Initialize with /init

You can create or update `AGENTS.md` automatically:

```
/init
```

The `/init` command scans your repository, may ask clarifying questions, and generates
concise project-specific guidance covering:
- Build, lint, and test commands
- Command order and verification steps
- Architecture and repository structure
- Project-specific conventions and operational gotchas

If `AGENTS.md` already exists, `/init` improves it in place instead of replacing it.

### 7.2 Template

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One paragraph: what the project is, what the default agent does, and how to use it.]

## Commands

- `[build command]` - Build the project
- `[test command]` - Run tests
- `[lint command]` - Lint and format code
- `[deploy command]` - Deploy to production

## Repo map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `[source dir]/` | [What lives here] |
| `.opencode/agents/` | Pipeline subagents ([list names]) |
| `.opencode/skills/` | Project skills ([list names]) |
| `.opencode/tools/` | Custom tools ([list names]) |
| `.opencode/workspace/` | Pipeline artifacts: research/, briefs/, drafts/, reports/ |

## [Domain rules]

- [Rule 1: e.g., frontmatter schema constraints]
- [Rule 2: e.g., naming conventions]
- [Rule 3: e.g., what sources are allowed/banned]

## Deploy

`[build command]` → `[output dir]` ([hosting platform]). Push to `main` auto-deploys.

## Tooling conventions

- Python helpers: `python3 .opencode/tools/*.py` (run from repo root).
- Commit style: short imperative, e.g. `feat: description`.
```

### 7.3 Custom Instructions Array

For larger projects, use `opencode.json` to reference additional instruction files:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "instructions": [
    "CONTRIBUTING.md",
    "docs/guidelines.md",
    ".cursor/rules/*.md"
  ]
}
```

This avoids duplicating existing documentation into AGENTS.md. Supports glob patterns
for monorepos: `packages/*/AGENTS.md`

---

## Phase 8: Create Custom Commands (Optional)

Commands are reusable prompt templates that execute when you type `/command-name` in
the OpenCode TUI. They're useful for repetitive workflows in your agent pipeline.

### 8.1 When to Create Commands

Create commands for tasks your team runs frequently:
- Running the full pipeline on a topic
- Testing and reviewing output
- Analyzing recent changes
- Generating reports
- Deploying to production

### 8.2 Command File Template

Create markdown files in `.opencode/commands/`:

**.opencode/commands/run-pipeline.md:**
```markdown
---
description: Run the full content pipeline
agent: coordinator
---

Run the complete pipeline for topic: $ARGUMENTS

Execute each agent in sequence:
1. Scout research
2. Planner brief
3. Writer draft
4. Editor review
5. Publisher deploy

Report progress after each step.
```

Usage: `/run-pipeline "AI trends 2024"`

### 8.3 Command Features

**Arguments:** Use `$ARGUMENTS` or `$1`, `$2`, `$3` for positional parameters

**Shell output:** Use !```command``` to inject bash output:
```markdown
Recent changes:
!`git log --oneline -10`
```

**File references:** Use `@filename` to include file content:
```markdown
Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx
```

### 8.4 Example Commands for Agent Teams

**.opencode/commands/status.md:**
```markdown
---
description: Check pipeline status
---

Check workspace status:
!`ls -la .opencode/workspace/*/`

Report which stages are complete and what's next.
```

**.opencode/commands/test-output.md:**
```markdown
---
description: Test and validate output
agent: editor
---

Review all output files:
!`find .opencode/workspace/final -type f`

Validate each file meets quality standards.
```

---

## Phase 9: Verify and Test

### 9.1 Verify structure

Check that all files exist:
```
opencode.json
AGENTS.md
.opencode/agents/[name].md (one per subagent)
.opencode/skills/[name]/SKILL.md (one per skill)
.opencode/tools/[name].py + [name].ts (one pair per tool)
.opencode/workspace/[subdir]/ (runtime dirs)
.opencode/package.json
.opencode/requirements.txt (if tools have Python deps)
```

Also verify that every generated subagent has an explicit model in frontmatter
and that the inline coordinator has an explicit model. For a single-model team,
the top-level `opencode.json` model must match every agent model.

### 9.2 Test the pipeline

1. Run `opencode` in the project directory.
2. Give the coordinator a test input.
3. Watch each subagent get spawned in order.
4. Check that workspace files are created at each step.
5. Verify the final output is correct.

### 9.3 Common issues

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Agent not found | Check `name` in agent .md matches the task subagent_type |
| Permission denied | Check the coordinator's `permission.task` whitelist |
| Tool not callable | Run `cd .opencode && npm install` for plugin deps |
| Python script fails | Check `requirements.txt` installed, check Python path |
| Model not found | Verify the model ID is valid for the opencode instance |

## Reference: Complete Example

Here is the full pattern from a working production setup (a content publishing pipeline):

### Pipeline
```
User → coordinator → scout → planner → writer → illustrator → editor → publisher
                                                                     ↓
                                                              Optimizer (on demand)
```

### opencode.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "default_agent": "coordinator",
  "model": "opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free",
  "instructions": ["AGENTS.md"],
  "mcp": {

### Agent file (scout.md)
```markdown
---
name: scout
description: Researches topics and saves a research brief.
mode: subagent
model: opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free
temperature: 0.3
permission:
  edit:
    "*": ask
    ".opencode/workspace/research/**": allow
    ".opencode/workspace/data/**": allow
  bash:
    "*": allow
    "python3 .opencode/tools/*.py *": allow
---
# Scout

## Mission
Turn a raw topic into a dated, sourced research file.

## Steps
1. Run `python3 .opencode/tools/search_web.py "<topic>"` to gather sources.
2. Extract hard facts: dates, names, numbers, quotes.
3. Save to `.opencode/workspace/research/{slug}.md`.

## Rules
- Research only. Do not write the article.
- Never invent facts. If missing, write "unavailable".
```

### Tool (search_web.ts)
```typescript
import { tool } from "@opencode-ai/plugin"
import path from "path"

export default tool({
  description: "Search the web for information.",
  args: {
    query: tool.schema.string().describe("Search query"),
  },
  async execute(args, context) {
    const script = path.join(context.worktree, ".opencode/tools/search_web.py")
    const result = await Bun.$`python3 ${script} ${args.query}`.text()
    return result.trim()
  },
})
```

### Skill (research-workflow/SKILL.md)
```markdown
---
name: research-workflow
description: Research workflow — web search, source grading, fact recording.
---

# Research Workflow

## Search
- `python3 .opencode/tools/search_web.py "<query>"`

## Grading sources
- Tier A: official statements
- Tier B: established outlets
- Tier C: blogs, forums — leads only

## Recording facts
Only write facts with a source. Note: what, when, who, URL.
```

## Checklist: Complete Agent Team Setup

- [ ] Model: Default to `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` unless user specifies otherwise
- [ ] Reference-first protocol: read the relevant `references/` files before any answer or config edit
- [ ] Plan: pipeline steps, agents, handoffs, tools, model, temperatures
- [ ] Create `.opencode/` directory structure
- [ ] Create `.opencode/package.json` and run `npm install`
- [ ] Create `.opencode/.gitignore`
- [ ] Create workspace subdirectories
- [ ] Create `opencode.json` with coordinator, an explicit coordinator model, and the selected provider/model
- [ ] Create `AGENTS.md` with project context (or run `/init`)
- [ ] Create one `.md` per subagent in `.opencode/agents/` (with the selected model in frontmatter)
- [ ] Create one `SKILL.md` per skill in `.opencode/skills/[name]/`
- [ ] Create `.py` + `.ts` pairs per tool in `.opencode/tools/`
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` for Python deps
- [ ] Create custom commands in `.opencode/commands/` (optional)
- [ ] Audit every generated agent for a missing or inconsistent `model:` field before reporting success
- [ ] Test the pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Fix any issues from testing
